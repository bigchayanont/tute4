    "text": "Australians say AI shouldn’t produce political news, but it’s OK for sport: new research\nThis article studied is from The conversation, named Australians say AI shouldn’t produce political news, but it’s OK for sport: new research, accessed via link .This article is under print media, although it is online, as it is produced by trained journalists.\nSummary: The article shows that Australians prefer human-written news, especially in politics. For less sensitive topics like sports and entertainment, they are more open to AI-generated content, with familiarity and trust influencing their comfort with AI.\nBackground: \n\nThere has been a lot of hype about the emergence of generative AI products such as ChatGPT. Organisations, including news outlets, are rapidly adopting artificial intelligence technologies to boost productivity and creativity.\n\nThe first paragraph states an importance of generative AI to various organization including news producing industry to increase efficiency of their work.\nLede: \n\nBut what does the public think about the increasing role of AI in the production of news?\n\nThe lede of this article is on the 2nd paragraph. This question draw readers in by addressing public opinions towards generative AI and prepares them for findings.\nSummarize:\n\nThis year’s Digital News Report: Australia 2024 finds Australians prefer news that is made by humans, rather than AI, but the degree of discomfort depends on the topic.\n\nThe summary of this article is on the 5th paragraph. This tells the reader that Australian prefer human written news than AI, while degree of acceptance in AI varying by topics of the article.\nMain result:\n\nThese findings suggest attitudes towards AI in news may change over time as audiences become more familiar with it. They also highlight the important role news organisations can play in helping to explain how they use the technology.\n\nThe main result of this article is on the 9th paragraph. These findings suggest that perspectives toward AI in new or articles could shift as reader become more familiar with technology. They also point out that news organizations could clarify emerging technology to the public.\n\n\nWordle, 15 Million Tweets Later\nThis article studied is from Robert Lesser, named Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later, accessed via link. This article is under block posts category.\nSummary: This article analyzes Wordle’s popularity rises around the globe and investigates reasons why scores are dropping over time, reflecting the trend that increasing game difficulty due to uncommon letter and word usage factors. The study is based on dataset of 15 millions tweets on x, highlighting that these elements account for a score changes.\nLede:\n\nSince the start of the year, the online word game Wordle has overtaken “crossword” (by 10x), “olympics” (2x) and even “covid” (1.5x) in Google Trends data. News outlets cover the game down to each day’s answer, and it apparently helped end a hostage situation in Illinois. The New York Times recently purchased Wordle for a “low seven-figures” sum.\n\nThe lede of this article is on the 1st paragraph. By giving statistics from Google Trend data, media attention and surprising acquisition, it is a good lede drawing readers attention to the article.\nBackground:\n\nFirst created in June 2021 and made public in October 2021, it’s addicting by nature: one game a day with a good difficulty curve — usually winnable in six tries, but harder to guess in fewer. But it didn’t take off until it added the “Share” button in mid-December, and arrays of cryptic emojis started appearing on people’s feeds.\n\nThe background of this article is on the 2nd paragraph. The writers are addressing the succession factors behind the game. Even though it is released on October, it become widely spread after Share function released in December for players to share their results on social media.\nSummarize:\n\nTHEORY 1: As more people find and play Wordle, the average player is getting worse at the game. One reason for this could be that the first people to find, play, and share Wordle were more avid puzzle and word-game players, and therefore did better than those that found it later.\n\n\nTHEORY 2: The social stigma associated with bad Wordle scores is decreasing. This could be a bit of a feedback loop – as more people claim that Wordle is getting harder, players who might have done poorly will have less hesitation in posting their results.\n\nThe writer didn’t directly address the summary but provides two theories on the second last paragraph before section III. First one address on player skills and second relevant with social stigma.\nMain result:\n\nIn fact, date order is the fourth strongest predictor, after uncommon letters, double letters, and word prevalence. And this correlation is positive, meaning average Wordle scores are getting worse over time.\n\nThe results has been shown in each analysis section. For the first one is there are various factors that make the game harder.\n\nThe strong relationship between Wordle difficulty and tweet volume bolsters the idea of the “highlight reel” effect, that players are less likely to share poor results.\n\nAlso, results sharing, one of the key success factor of Wordle, shows that players are less likely to share their bad results.\n\n\nWe analysed 4,678,387 NBA shots\nThis article studied is from Youtube channel called Stand-up Maths, named We analysed 4,678,387 NBA shots, accessed via link. This article is under video category.\nSummary:  This video explores into the evolution of basketball strategies over time, mainly focusing on the rise of three-point shots in the NBA over the past decades. They use statistical data analysis to interpret that players are taking more longer shots for higher scoring and it came out that by average, three-points shoot scores more points.\nLede:\n\nToday we’ll be looking at the math of basketball answering such questions.\n\nIn time stamp 00:08, the speaker tries to lead the audience to explore integration between math and basketball, despite the apparent difference, which can provide deep insight into basketball strategies using data-driven analysis.\nBackground:\n\nIf you shoot from outside the three-point line which is a long way out you get three points a fifty percent increase and I have the general impression that over the last decade or so three-point shots have become more prevalent not just regular threes from the line some deep three-point shots.\n\nStarting from time stamp 00:38, the speaker has provided a significance of shooting for three points instead of two. Also, over decades, not only three-point shots have become more often but also deeper shots. This sets topic for more exploration and analysis.\nSummarize:\n\nwe know NBA players are shooting from further out we know they’re doing it because they’re getting more points on average\n\nOn time stamp 16:00, Matt has indicates from the data that NBA players are shooting further to get more points on average from analytics data.\nMain result:\n\nThe moral of the story is why would you get 0.8 points per average here if you can step back a few inches and get 1.1 points.\n\nAfter an analysis from 4 millions NBA shooting records, Matt has interpreted his analysis with his sample and NBA data set and found that by shooting at shorter range the average score is less than shooting at the back of the three-point line.\n\n\nCompare and contrast\nFirst news with data Second data journalism\nboth of them uses data but approach differently. The first article refers to integrating data into news reporting The second article is whereas data is a key point. Data journalism rely on data rather than\naudience"
